## What is an “interpreted” language?

A programming language that can't run on your processor directly. It instead has to be fed into a virtual machine that acts as a middleman. The virtual machine takes in the interpreted language's code on one side and speaks natively to the operating system and processor on the other. The advantage of this approach is that it allows you to write your code once and execute it on many different operating systems and hardware platforms.
